# E-commerce_back_end

## Description
  This project allows the user to add products, categories, product tags, and tags to the eccommerce_database. This app is the backend only, so the user has to make these changes through the use of an application like Insomnia or Postman. This is a full backend for an eccommerce based site. The user could apply this to a front end that they create.
